Hosting a static website can be expensive and time-consuming to set up. This also means you have to pay at least $5 each
month for something simple and possibly low traffic as a portfolio, blog or open source demo website.

Luckily there is an easy way to host a static website for free: [**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/). Github
Pages makes it possible to host static content like html documents from a simple GitHub repository. Not only do they
offer this hosting for *free*, you also get a free subdomain `<username>.github.io` that includes a secure `https`
connection.

## Getting started

## Using a builder/bundler

For a lot of static sites the HTML documents and assets are not manually put together but rather built or generated. An
example is the website you are currently on is made using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com)
and [React](https://reactjs.org).

## Use a custom domain

GitHub makes it possible to use a custom domain instead of `<username>.github.io`. First you need to register the domain
name and make sure you have access to change DNS settings.

I created this personal website recently. I wrote a blog post about it which you can
find [here](/blog/how-i-built-my-website). The website is statically generated with a bunch of HTML, CSS and JS files.
